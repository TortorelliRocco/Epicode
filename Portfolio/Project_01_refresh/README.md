Description
This project is part of my Data Analyst skill refresh after completing a professional bootcamp.
The goal is to rebuild fluency with real data and focus on clarity rather than perfection.

Status
Work in progress – insights and structure will be improved iteratively.


## Refresh Notes – Data Model Review

### Market table
- Identified 3 columns likely unused for analysis
- Need to confirm whether they are required for any visuals or measures

### Country table
- Two columns represent the same concept (absolute value vs percentage)
- Potential redundancy – normalization or single source of truth needed

### Data Model
- Primary key structure not clearly documented
- Need to review which columns uniquely identify records
- Relationships currently working but require validation

### Next steps
- Validate primary keys
- Simplify tables where possible
- Review visual interactions after data model cleanup
